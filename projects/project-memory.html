                        <p>Are first-hand experiences truly formative of one's identity? After all, we're constantly immersed in stories told by other people, lessons imparted via song and tale. If experience were the primary shaper of one's character, could a  implanted memories change a person without the need of living through trauma, happiness, or conflict? I drew inspiration from famous sci-fi movies and novels like <i>Blade Runner</i>.</p>

                        <br>What would one lose if one donates a memory? Likewise, what does one gain when one receives a memory? 
                        <br>Moreover, I'm hoping that the artifact acts as a lens with which one could reflect on one's own identity. Are one's memories and experiences formative of their identities? Could a technology like this change our entire perception of self?</p>

Beyond that, I believe that immersing users within the experience would help make the concept feel more real and relateable.</p>

                        <p>I wanted to build both a donation and a retrieval center, with an emphasis on the retrieval end. Users would ingest a pill, and receive a barrage of sensory inputs including light, sound, and smell.</p>

                        <p>An aspect I wanted to emphasize was the seamless union of digital and physical. While the user donating a memory fills out a questionnaire, the data is being stored digitally and linked to a physical token that is later dispensed, containing either a barcode or RFID tag. This would allow individuals on the receiving end to pick out a physical token, scan it, and begin the experience.</p>

                        <h2>The challenge of immersion</h2>
                        <p>I wished that a tangible component would work to further immerse the user. Being able to see leave a mark on a token, and have that be also digitally represented, and vice versa, that was my vision. At the same time, though, I needed to maintain a suspension of disbelief: the experience needed to be familiar just enough to prevent confusion, but novel and alien to the degree that users wouldn't question the realism of the technology.</p>

                        <p>I eventually discarded the retrieval side, as the light and sound show would be amateurish and abstract. The fidelity of these outputted senses would also be completely reliant on a survey meant to be kept short. Trying to capitalize on the immersion of the donation side, I played with the idea of allowing users to model clay figures representing their childhood memories. However, the disconnect between the digital and physical compenents would be jarring, and pushing around clay seemed prehistoric.</p>

                        <h2>A breakthrough in plaster</h2>
                        <p>While thinking of different ways a mark could be made instantaneously, in a controlled environment, while being novel, I was at a roadblock. Letting users make the mark themselves seemed too easy, so it had to be automated, yet able to be tweaked and be representative of each unique memory. Colored ink seemed to be the solution, but a token made out of paper would be too boring, and the ink would run. The ink wouldn't stand out on wood either. I just happened to have watched a documentary about Michaelangelo and his fresco painting when it hit me: plaster was the key! Ink on plaster is almost instantly absorbed, locking in the vibrancy on a pure white background. The surface of the plaster could be molded a three dimensionally, and it could also be embedded with an RFID tag. A plaster token would have a pristine, refined, yet delicate quality.<p>
